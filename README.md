## Design & content

I made some updates to the sections ( 5 Sections), titles & contents.
Adding some images & links.
To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## html file

linking the js file.
Creating two sections.
Updating the contents.
Creat an up button

## Navigation Bar

I created the navigation bar menu and used the css style to get a smooth scrolling when clicking in link to section.

## Section Active State

I tried to make the sections active when scrolling & ancroing but it dosen't work.
but i sucssed to make it active by clicking on the section.
(need more time to figuer what's wrong).

I tried also to make the sections collapsed, but i didn't have enough time too.
